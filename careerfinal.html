            <p>
            I have graduated from Georgia State University with a B.A. in history and minor in political science in 2014. After graduating from GSU, I attended Valparaiso University Law School and earned my JD. I have worked mostly in personal injury law firms as well as some experience in family law. After working in a few law firms throughout the past couple of years, I ultimately decided to pursue a MLIS degree to change my career path. I am currently in my final semester of earning a MLIS degree at Dominican University. My goal after I graduate this semester is to teach legal research to first year law students in law schools. Eventually, much further down the line, my goal is to hold a law library director role. Although a law library director is a stressful position, I think that witnessing first year law students succeed and learn will be rewarding. For now, I am focused on starting my career as a law librarian after I graduate.
