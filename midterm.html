                We have over 50,000 wonderful used books, records, videos, magazines, and more at our monthly sale. Our Main room is along the north driveway, adjacent to the Charleston Shopping Center. In this room, hardbound books start at $1 each and paperback books at $.50 each for purchase. If you would like to donate, please bring your book donations to this room. 
                </p>

                Children's books, music, videos, and toys are in our New room near the Cubberley track, Pavilion, and the Greendell School. You can find picture books,  fiction and nonfiction books, foreign language books, CDs, DVDs, as well as books for parents and teachers all for $.50 to $1 in this room! During the first hour of the sale on Saturday, please select no more than 12 books at a time. You may bring your selected books to the cashiers for hold until you are ready to purchase all 12 of your books.

                Our bargain books are in rooms K6 and K7, where hardbound books are all $1, paperbacks are $.50, and children's books are $.25 each! On Sunday, prices in the Bargain room are half-off. Plus you can save even more by purchasing grocery bags from us for $5 each and then filling them with your purchase items. You can also purchase gift certificates at the sale in $5 denominations. Please note that the Children's and Bargain rooms open one hour earlier than the Main room on Saturday. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                Make sure to arrive early on Saturday because we disburse a maximum of 200 numbered tickets at the Main room at 8:00 a.m. The number on your ticket reserves your place in line, allowing you to leave the premises. Please be sure to return to the Main room a few minutes before the book sale opens to reclaim your place in line. IF YOU MISS THE TIME WHEN YOUR TICKET NUMBER IS ALLOWED TO ENTER THE MAIN ROOM YOU WILL FORFEIT YOUR PLACE IN LINE. If you do not arrive in time to purchase a ticket, please join the end of the line. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                We have limited space in the Main room and will allow 160 customers in at a time due to compelling health and safety regulations. Once inside customers may purchase items and exit via the east door. If desired, customers may stand in line at the north door to reenter. Note that 12 books per customer limit will remain if there is a line outside. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                You will find the lowest prices on all of our items and 100% of your purchase will go to local libraries!
