                 My name is Hamaseh and I have lived in the southeastern US for the majority of my life (yes I say y'all sometimes and like sweet iced tea!). I have also lived in the midwest, Indiana and Illinois, for about seven years now. Some of my hobbies and interests include going to the gym, shopping, interior decor, swimming, tennis, history, and psychology to name a few. I initially took LIS 753 Internet Fundamentals course at Dominican University to be a well-rounded individual and to gain knowledge in an area which I previously had no background in. Now that the semester is almost over, I consider coding as one of my hobbies because I had a lot of fun learning about coding this semester. I plan on practicing and learning more about coding after the semester is over.
