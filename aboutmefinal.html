             I grew up and have lived in the south for most of my life (yes I say y'all sometimes and love sweet iced tea!) I have also lived in the midwest, Indiana and Illinois, for about seven years now. Some of my hobbies and interests includes going to the gym, shopping, interior decor, swimming, tennis, history, and psychology to name a few. I initially took LIS 753 Internet Fundamentals course to be a well-rounded individual and to gain knowledge in an area which I previously had no background in. Now that the semester is almost over, I consider coding as one of my hobbies because I had a lot of fun learning about coding this semester. I plan on practicing and learning more about coding after the semester is over.
